### Author: Collin Paiz

### Institution: Santa Clara University

### Professor: Dr. David Anastasiu

### Session: Fall 2022

## Overview

#### This repository includes various C/C++ programs from the lab section of COEN 145: Parallel Computing.

## Lab 1 - HPC Introduction

#### Get started with SCU's Wave HPC.

## Lab 2 - OpenMP Basics

#### Get started with OpenMP basics and parallelize a program using parallel loops and various synchronization methods.

## Lab 3 - OpenMP Threads

#### Parallelize a program that performs array addition.

## Lab 4 - OpenMP Synchronization

#### Parallelize a program that utilizes synchronization methods to generate a Logarithmic Series and save the output into an array.

## Lab 5 - Reduction

#### Parallelize a program that compares two arrays and save the higher values in the output array. Decide which clause: firstprivate, lastprivate, recduction, copyprivate, and copyin is best for the given situation.

## Lab 6 - MPI Basics

#### Parallelize a program that performs array addition using MPI.

## Lab 7 - MPI Collective Communication

#### Parallelize a program that solves the 1D Time Dependent Heat Equation using MPI collective communication.

## Lab 8 - MPI Scatter/Gather

#### Parallelize a program that generates the same sequence of random numbers for both sequential execution and parallel execution under MPI using a linear congruential random number generator.

## Lab 9 - OpenACC Basics

#### Parallelize a program that performs array multiplication using OpenACC.
